- **Comprehensive visualization** including time-domain plots, magnitude spectra, and phase spectra
- **Real-time audio playback** to hear the effects of processing
- **Parameter exploration** with various cutoff frequencies and modulation indices
- **Professional-quality plots** with consistent styling and labeling

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Audio System Toolbox (for recording/playback functions)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Run each part sequentially in MATLAB
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to select input methods and parameters
4. Results will be saved automatically in the selected directory

## Results

All generated plots and audio files are automatically saved to a user-selected directory, including:

# Communications_Systems-Modulation_and_Demodulation_Project
A MATLAB-based project exploring analog communication techniques, including voice signal processing, AM (DSB-LC, DSB-SC, SSB-SC), and FM modulation/demodulation. Features low-pass filtering, frequency offset experiments, noise performance analysis, and time/frequency domain visualizations with audio playback.
